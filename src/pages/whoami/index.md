My name is Ahmad and I'm a penetration tester and security researcher.<!-- end --> 

I've always been in the habit of creating personal notes but I've decided to start sharing them in hopes of:

1.  Providing <i>potentially</i> useful techniques that may assist others during penetration tests/red team engagements
2.  Presenting new security research
3.  Explaining complex concepts in a simplified and causal way

I'm always open to feedback, suggestions and constructive comments. Feel free to reach out, I respond reasonably quick.
